Mangukiya Hitesh Bhagavanbhai,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. The features ate not the best but most useful ones are working well with smooth sensor. The stainless still belts don’t look good so I had to change it with silicon belt.,Smoke,4 November 2025,The dial size is the good fit.

Raghu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pros:Watch is awesome.Battery can last long for 1 week even if it is used for full time.Display is good.Options are good.Bought it for 1990 Rs.Good look at wrist.You can answer a call and talk over a watch itself.Cons:Connectivity between phone app and watch frequently disconnects.Steps count accuracy to be improved.,Charcoal Black,17 August 2025,FS2 review
Dhruv Sahu,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall the watch is good, but what I didn't liked about this watch is that, it can store only 5 watch faces, there are around 100 watch faces on the cloud, but you can store only any five in the watch i mean smartwatch which cost around 800 900 can store more than 10 12 watch faces, but even at this price point of 2799 , Fastrack is giving us only 5 watch faces.. which is totally disappointing..",Black_Metal,10 October 2025,Watchfaces only 5

Manighandan007,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The silver design is sleek and the battery life is impressive. It offers the typical features of most smartwatches, including alarm, step tracking and goal-setting for walking. However, like all smartwatches, it’s not 100% accurate in step counting—it adds steps while traveling on metro, buses, or bikes. Overall, it does the job, has a solid build, and even survived in heavy rain.",Silver,21 September 2025,Great battery backup
